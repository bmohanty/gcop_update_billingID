# gcop_update_billingID
For Google Cloud, mass update script to change all projects in an org to another billing ID. 

To update a project's billing ID in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you need the following permissions:

Billing Account Administrator: This role grants full permissions to manage billing accounts, including linking and unlinking projects.
Project Owner: This role allows you to manage all aspects of a project, including billing.
If you have either of these roles, you can follow these steps to update the billing ID of a project:

Go to the Billing section of the Google Cloud console.
Select the project you want to update.
Click on the Manage billing link.
Select the new billing account from the dropdown menu.
Click on the Set account button to confirm the change.
Please note that if you don't have the necessary permissions, you'll need to contact a Billing Account Administrator or Project Owner to make the change for you.
